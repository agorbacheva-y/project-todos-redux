# Project Todos

Technigo Week 9 Project - Ayumi Gorbacheva-Yamamoto

The assignment was to create a todo app using Redux and Redux Toolkit.

## The problem

I started the project by creating a basic version of a todo app, with an add and remove todo action to practice reducers.
Additional features were added one by one by using either redux or local state if it affected only the local component.
